Hi 

{% if line == "alogator inactivity_threshold reached" %}The inactivity threshold for {% if pattern %}'{{ pattern }}' in {% endif %}'{{ path }}' has been exceeded.
{% else %}Alogator was in action and found '{{ pattern }}' in '{{ path }}'.
The full line containing the pattern was: 

    {{ line }}
{% endif %}
Happy to help.
